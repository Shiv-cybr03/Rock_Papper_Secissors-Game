Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

1.Rock (a fist)
2.Paper (an open hand)
3.Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

## Here's how the game works:

Rock: Form a fist with your hand. Rock crushes scissors.

Paper: Open your hand flat. Paper covers rock.

Scissors: Extend your index and middle fingers, forming a V. Scissors cut paper.

## The rules for determining the winner are straightforward:

Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
The game is often used as a decision-making tool or a quick and fun way to settle disputes. Players typically count to three in unison and simultaneously reveal their chosen shape. The winner is determined based on the interactions between the chosen shapes.

If both players choose the same element, the game is a tie or a draw, and it is often played again.
